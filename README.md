This package provides a clustering method for finding small compact clusters in a high dimensional descriptor space.

The algorithm is used in the publication: "Density-of-states similarity descriptor for unsupervised learning from materials data" by Martin Kuban, Santiago Rigamonti, Markus Scheidgen, and Claudia Draxl.
